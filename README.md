environment: Environments for performing each code are stored in this directory./

For performing BO (edbo.yml): Python (3.7.12) was used as a language, and used packages were edbo (0.1.0) and pandas (1.3.5).

For using general ML investigations (OPSsearch.yml): Python (3.9.20) was used as a language, and used packages were adapt (0.4.4), matplotlib (3.9.2), numpy (1.26.4), pandas (2.2.3), rdkit (2024.9.5), scikit-learn (1.5.2), scipy (1.12.0), seaborn (0.13.2), and xgboost (2.1.4).
